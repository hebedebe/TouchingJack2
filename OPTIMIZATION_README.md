## üéÆ Performance Features

### In-Game Performance Monitor
- Press **F1** to toggle the performance dashboard
- Monitor FPS, memory usage, cache hit rates in real-time
- Automatic performance warnings for issues

### Optimization Systems

#### Sprite Cache System
- Caches transformed sprites to avoid expensive pygame operations
- Automatic memory management with LRU eviction
- Cache hit rates typically >90% after warmup

#### Object Pooling
- Reuses Actor, Component, and UI objects
- Dramatically reduces garbage collection overhead
- Configurable pool sizes per object type

#### Memory Management
- Automatic memory monitoring and cleanup
- Intelligent garbage collection scheduling
- Memory usage alerts and optimization

#### Fast Math Operations
- Numba JIT-compiled math functions
- Optional Cython extensions for maximum speed
- Optimized vector operations and collision detection

## üìä Performance Improvements

Expected performance improvements over the original:

- **2-4x faster sprite rendering** (with caching)
- **50-70% reduction in memory allocations** (object pooling)
- **30-50% better frame times** (various optimizations)
- **Reduced garbage collection pauses** (memory management)
- **Better cache locality** (data structure optimizations)

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Performance Dashboard (F1)
- Current FPS and frame time
- Memory usage and trends
- Cache hit rates
- Draw call counts
- Sprite rendering statistics

### Console Logging
The optimized version provides detailed performance logging:
- Startup optimization summary
- Cache performance statistics
- Memory cleanup notifications
- Performance warnings for bottlenecks

### Performance Analysis
Use the performance monitor to identify:
- Frame rate drops and their causes
- Memory usage patterns
- Cache efficiency
- Rendering bottlenecks

## üéØ Optimization Strategies Used

### Rendering Optimizations
1. **Sprite Transform Caching**: Avoid repeated pygame.transform operations
2. **Batch Rendering**: Group similar sprites for efficient rendering
3. **OpenGL Post-Processing**: Leverage GPU for shader effects
4. **Dirty Rectangle Tracking**: Only redraw changed screen regions

### Memory Optimizations
1. **Object Pooling**: Reuse frequently created/destroyed objects
2. **Smart Garbage Collection**: Schedule GC during low-activity periods
3. **Memory Monitoring**: Track and limit memory usage
4. **Weak References**: Prevent memory leaks in caching systems

### CPU Optimizations
1. **Numba JIT Compilation**: Speed up mathematical operations
2. **Cython Extensions**: Native C performance for critical paths
3. **Algorithm Improvements**: Better data structures and algorithms
4. **Multithreading**: Async asset loading and background tasks

### Asset Optimizations
1. **Smart Preloading**: Load critical assets at startup
2. **Asset Compression**: Reduce memory footprint
3. **Cache Management**: Intelligent asset eviction policies
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load assets only when needed

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Cython Extensions Won't Build
If Cython extensions fail to build:
1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows)
2. The game will still run with Python/Numba optimizations
3. Check console output for specific build errors

### Low Performance
If you experience low performance:
1. Press F1 to view the performance dashboard
2. Check memory usage - high memory may trigger cleanup
3. Monitor cache hit rates - low rates indicate cache issues
4. Check console for performance warnings

### Memory Issues
If memory usage is high:
1. The system will automatically trigger cleanup
2. Force cleanup by calling `memory_manager.cleanup_memory(force=True)`
3. Check for memory leaks in custom code
4. Monitor tracked object counts
